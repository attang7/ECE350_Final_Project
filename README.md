# ECE350_Final_Project
Python Code for distance sensor project

Just a simple Python code for this final project.

For this final project, with the constraints given, I simulated a basic distance sensor that would be useful for the visually impaired. 
Utilizing an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance of the area in front of the user, data would be sent through the raspberry pi and then displayed via 
the LED display bar which was used for prototyping purposes. 

If actually committed to expanding on, an external battery would make the project portable as intended. More haptic feature could be added such as speakers 
or vibrating motors.
